{"bio":{"data":"<p>Chibụike Ụzọma (b.1992, Port Harcourt) is a multidisciplinary artist working in painting, photography, drawing, texts, and video. Treating art simultaneously as a subject and an object, Chibụike engenders images with superstition of meaning— making subject matter a pretext for performance and context a fluid ground. He received his BFA from the University of Benin and his MFA from Yale School of Art.</p>\n\n<p>Chibụike has participated in exhibitions (solo and group), festivals, and residencies at galleries, museums, and other art institutions in Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. Chibụike presently lives and works in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>"},"dear audience":{"data":"<p>i am writing to offer some insights and also share some observations i witnessed concerning the artworks featured on this website as a sample of my practice.</p>\n\n<p>the artworks function as platforms to stimulate and/or sustain thought. in that way, they could help you reimagine the functionalities of objects (art also constituting objects) and reconsider your sources of knowledge. through form, they complicate historical specificity, possessing indefinite meaning and uses. the artworks go on to make legible, the pretentious concepts of universalism, which tend to monopolize and replace subjectivity with a yet to be attained objectivity.</p>\n\n<p>i am not consciously scripting or telling a story (narrative) with the artworks because anything functioning as a repository of memory(ies) already has and tells a story. therefore, the artworks perform innate poetics with the materials and subject(s) they are composed of and reveal (a) meaning/narrative(s) to on-lookers with varied shades of truth.</p>\n\n<p>the artworks were made at different points in time and ideological crossroads. according to various criteria, appearance being the most common, they could be grouped into series. however, they appear sporadically on this website as individual samples or clippings from recent exhibitions. i sometimes perceive the artworks to function like sunsets, which occur whether we are watching the horizon or not. therefore, the art exists independently of our empathy or solidarity.</p>\n\n<p>at the time of writing this note, i am uncertain what this kind of art should be called. it is a constellation of aesthetic idioms. however, to call it “black art” out of convenience, based on knowledge of my ancestry, is quite limiting, and harmful to your (the audience’s) ability to use imagination, intuition, experience, and/or other sensory and sensuous faculties when approaching the artwork.</p>\n\n<p>i hope you enjoy scrolling through the artwork on this website— finding meaning and narrative(s) for your individual and collective selves as you go along. and if nothing else, i hope you at least beheld beautiful images.</p>\n\n<p>there is a saying among elders, “wherever something stands, something else will stand beside it.” one proverb puts forward a truth, another another— there is no absolute. so, be in touch when and if you can. i prefer conversations to grand statements.</p>\n\n<p>best wishes,</p>\n\n<p>chibụike</p>"},"info":{"data":"<p><a href=\"mailto:studio@chibuikeuzoma.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">studio@chibuikeuzoma.com</a><br>\nWebsite designed and developed by ­Alvin Ashiatey</p>"}}
